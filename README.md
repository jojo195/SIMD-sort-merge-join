#SIMD accelerated sort merge network

For parallel computing lesson homework only

By running *./run.sh* you can get profiling file in the *profile* directory.

Where you can get performance of quicksort merge join algorithm, merge sort merge join algorithm, $4 \times 4$ merge join algorithm, $8 \times 8$ merge join algorithm
